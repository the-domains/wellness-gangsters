Rule:
The individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. To any degree one is not self-mastered, he shall be governed by others.

Illumination: 

What is freedom but the choice to choose and live from a place that is authentically you?
But how many choices are made that are subliminally or obviously influenced by other sources that lie outside of you? 

Too many. 

The cracks and crevices of your life that are void of self-mastery will be filled and flooded by outside sources that are seeking to control you at an unforgiving rate. 

Don't be controlled by others and thereby forfeit your freedom in this one shot at life. 

Master your Self instead. 

# Application: 

Mindfully untangle and pay hyper attention to the decisions you make and why you made them.
Uncover whether they were a product of your true desires, or a consequence of someone else's. 

Here are some real-life examples of forfeited freedom for the sake of others: 

--Trying to impress someone ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/640e1bd7-97ff-44fc-bae1-9899e6f9dfa6.jpg)

--Following laws instead of intuition 

--Emulating others 

--Falling into peer pressure 

--Dressing according to standards and not personal desire 

--Wearing makeup to attract a mate 

--Doing things at work against your wants or morals because it's your job 

This, of course, doesn't mean you have to quit your job, move to the jungle and run around naked while breaking the law.
Although, I wouldn't put that last on the list of things to do. 

What it means is that you should comprehend what it is you want, what it is you are doing, and why they are not aligned. 

Then, take practical steps to regain control of those aspects in your life.
Repeat. 

Self-Mastery is a lifelong quest. 
But for everyday you practice it, you will have lived another day that is yours.
